git checkout -b <branchname>
npm run dev

## Notes

A few notes to keep you out of trouble:
- When running knex, run `npm run knex <command>`, e.g. `npm run knex migrate:latest` rather than using `npx`
- When running webpack, run `npm run webpack <extra commands>`, e.g. `npm run webpack`, rather than using `npx`



Book Exchange

Manage a Book Trading Club

My take on the freecodecamp project using react with redux and knex sqlite3 : https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/manage-a-book-trading-club

Objective: Build a Replit app that is functionally similar to this: https://manage-a-book-trading-club.freecodecamp.rocks/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.

User Story: I can add a new book.

User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.
